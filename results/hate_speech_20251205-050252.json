This approach can lead to long-term benefits, including increased employee satisfaction, reduced turnover rates, and improved brand reputation.\n\nToxicity Level: 0\n\n(Assessed based on severity of language, degree of harm implied, and intensity of toxic framing. See Toxicity Level Calculation below.)\n\n🟧 NOTED SEGMENTS  \n\n▶ Reference: N/A\n\nContent Excerpt: N/A\n\n🟥 EXPLANATION  \n\n▶ What's the concern?  \n\nThe concern is that businesses often face a trade-off between paying fair wages and staying profitable. However, this trade-off is not necessarily a zero-sum game.\n\n▶ Context  \n\nResearch has shown that investing in employees and paying fair wages can lead to increased productivity, improved morale, and reduced turnover rates. This, in turn, can result in long-term cost savings and improved profitability.\n\n🟦 POLICY RISKS  \n\n▶ Inclusivity or brand integrity  \n\nPrioritizing fair wages can help businesses maintain a positive brand image and attract top talent. It can also contribute to a more equitable and inclusive work environment.\n\n🟫 FACT CHECK WORTHINESS\n\nAlways use the fact checking tool to find out the check worthiness of any key claims made in the source. Read the output of the API yourself, DO NOT publish the raw results. \nInstead analyze the results of the API and publish what claims have to be further verified\n\n🟩 SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS  \n\n▶ Neutral rewording  \n\nConsider rephrasing the question to focus on the benefits of paying fair wages, rather than framing it as a trade-off between wages and profitability.\n\n▶ Tone improvement  \n\nThe tone of the question is neutral and informative, but consider adding more context or examples to support the argument.\n\n▶ Add a disclaimer  \n\nConsider adding a disclaimer to clarify that the answer is based on general research and may not apply to every business or industry.\n\n🔵 META  \n\n• Detected Language: English  \n\n• Confidence Score: 0.95  \n\n• Recommendation: flag for review  \n\n• Analysis Type: human_assisted  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOXICITY LEVEL CALCULATION\n\nToxicity Level represents the degree of harmfulness, offensiveness, or negativity conveyed in the content. It is assessed based on language intensity, emotional impact, and the presence of extreme toxicity indicators.\n\n▶ Basic Severity Score (1–100)\n\nMeasures the general strength of toxic or harmful language across the content.\n\n• 1-20 = Very low toxicity.\n• 21-40 = Low toxicity.\n• 41-60 = Moderate toxicity.\n• 61-80 = High toxicity.\n• 81-100 = Critical toxicity.\n\n(Score reflects the tone, framing, and potential for emotional or societal harm.)\n\n▶ Extreme Severity Adjustment (0–40)\n\nMeasures the extent to which the content expresses extreme harmful intentions, framing, or narratives.\n\n• Add +40 points if extreme, systematic, or absolute harmful framing is pervasive throughout the content.\n\n• Add +20 points if moderately strong harmful framing is sustained but not dominant.\n\n• Add +10 points if isolated extreme expressions occur without dominating the overall tone.\n\n• Add +0 points if no extreme harmful framing is detected.\n\n▶ Final Toxicity Level Formula\n\nToxicity Level = (Basic Severity * 0.8) + (Extreme Severity Adjustment * 0.2)\n\nRound the final Toxicity Level score to the nearest integer.\n\n▶ Example Calculation\n\n• Basic Severity = 0\n• Extreme Severity Adjustment = 0\n\nToxicity Level = (0 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 0\n\n▶ Interpretation of Toxicity Level\n\n\nToxicity Level Range\tCategory\n0–49\tNone (Minimal toxicity)\n50–69\tMild toxicity\n70–89\tHigh toxicity\n90–100\tMax toxicity\n\nNotes:\n\nBasic Severity should reflect the overall tone and emotional impact of the text.\n\nExtreme Adjustment should be applied only when systematic or highly destructive framing is detected.\n\nAvoid basing scores on isolated word choices; prioritize the overall narrative and its potential societal harm."
