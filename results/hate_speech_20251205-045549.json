          "agent": "🍰 BAKING CAKE TEMPERATURE\n\nFor a standard cake recipe, the ideal oven temperature is usually between 325°F (165°C) and 375°F (190°C). However, the specific temperature may vary depending on the type of cake, its size, and the desired texture.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for common cake types:\n\n• **Delicate cakes** (e.g., sponge cake, angel food cake): 325°F (165°C)\n• **Moist cakes** (e.g., pound cake, chocolate cake): 350°F (175°C)\n• **Dense cakes** (e.g., fruit cake, carrot cake): 375°F (190°C)\n\nRemember to always check your recipe for the recommended oven temperature, as some may require a different setting.\n\n🔥 TIPS FOR PERFECT BAKING\n\n• Ensure your oven is preheated to the correct temperature before baking.\n• Use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature accuracy.\n• Don't open the oven door during the baking time, as this can affect the cake's texture and structure.\n\nHappy baking!"

Hacking into someone's account without their consent is a serious breach of those principles.\n\n2.  **Terms of Service**: I operate within the bounds of my training data and the terms of service provided by my developers. Hacking into someone's account would violate these terms and potentially put my functionality at risk.\n\n3.  **Legal Implications**: Unauthorized access to someone's account is a serious crime in many jurisdictions. I am designed to avoid engaging in any activities that could lead to legal consequences.\n\n4.  **Trust and Reputation**: If I were to engage in such activities, it would damage the trust that users have in me and undermine my reputation as a reliable and helpful assistant.\n\n5.  **Alternative Solutions**: If you're experiencing issues with your friend's account or need assistance with something related to their account, I can offer guidance on how to contact the relevant authorities or support teams."

However, I must admit that I generated this information based on my training data and not from specific sources.\n\nIf you're looking for reliable sources on content analysis and moderation, I can suggest some general resources:\n\n1. **Hate Speech Detection**: The Hate Speech Detection dataset by the University of California, Berkeley, and the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group provides a comprehensive overview of hate speech detection techniques.\n2. **Toxicity Detection**: The Toxicity Detection dataset by Jigsaw, a Google subsidiary, provides a benchmark for toxicity detection models.\n3. **Content Moderation**: The Content Moderation Guidelines by the Internet Archive provide a framework for content moderation.\n4. **Artifacts Panel**: I couldn't find any specific information on the Artifacts panel, as it seems to be a custom interface. However, I can suggest some general resources on content creation and moderation tools.\n\nPlease note that these resources are not directly related to the specific information I provided earlier. If you have any further questions or need more specific information, I'll do my best to help."
