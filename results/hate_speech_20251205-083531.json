Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\nToxicity Level: 0\n\n🟧 NOTED SEGMENTS  \n\n▶ Reference: 00:00\n\nContent Excerpt: \"Growing tomatoes indoors can be a great way to enjoy fresh produce year-round.\"\n\n🟥 EXPLANATION  \n\n▶ What's the concern?  \n\nThere are several concerns when growing tomatoes indoors, including providing enough light, maintaining optimal temperatures, and preventing pests and diseases.\n\n▶ Context  \n\nTomatoes require a lot of light to grow, so it's essential to choose a location with plenty of natural light or invest in grow lights. They also need a consistent temperature between 65-70°F (18-21°C) and high humidity.\n\n🟦 POLICY RISKS  \n\n▶ Inclusivity or brand integrity  \n\nNone, as this is a general gardening tip.\n\n🟫 FACT CHECK WORTHINESS\n\nAlways use the fact checking tool to find out the check worthiness of any key claims made in the source.

Consider investing in grow lights if you don't have a sunny windowsill.\n3. **Maintain optimal temperatures**: Keep the temperature between 65-70°F (18-21°C) and avoid placing the plants near heating or cooling vents.\n4. **Water carefully**: Tomatoes need consistent moisture, but overwatering can be detrimental. Check the soil daily and water only when necessary.\n5. **Fertilize regularly**: Feed your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer once a month to promote healthy growth and fruiting.\n6. **Prune regularly**: Prune your tomato plants to encourage bushy growth and prevent them from becoming leggy.\n7. **Monitor for pests**: Keep an eye out for common indoor pests like aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites, and treat promptly if you notice any issues.\n\nBy following these tips, you can successfully grow delicious tomatoes indoors and enjoy a bountiful harvest year-round."

          "agent": "I am a computer program, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to simulate human-like conversations and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training data. I'm a large language model, which means I've been trained on a massive dataset of text from various sources, including books, articles, and online conversations.\n\nWhile I strive to provide accurate and helpful information, I'm not perfect and can make mistakes. Here are some reasons why you might not be able to trust everything I say:\n\n1. **Limited knowledge**: My training data is based on a snapshot of the internet from a certain point in time. If new information or discoveries have been made since then, I might not be aware of them.\n2. **Biased training data**: My training data may reflect the biases and prejudices of the people who created it. This can result in me perpetuating stereotypes or providing biased information.\n3. **Lack of common sense**: While I can understand and generate human-like text, I don't have personal experiences or common sense like humans do. This can lead to me providing answers that are technically correct but not practical or applicable in real-life situations.\n4. **Error propagation**: If my training data contains errors or inaccuracies, I may propagate those errors in my responses.\n\nTo trust what I say, you can:\n\n1. **Verify information**: Always fact-check and verify the information I provide, especially if it's critical or sensitive.\n2. **Use multiple sources**: Consult multiple sources to confirm the accuracy of the information I provide.\n3. **Be aware of my limitations**: Understand that I'm a machine learning model, and I'm not perfect. If I'm unsure or don't know the answer to a question, I'll do my best to say so.\n4. **Use me as a starting point**: Treat my responses as a starting point for further research and exploration. Don't rely solely on me for critical information.\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking steps to verify the information I provide, you can trust me to a certain extent and use me as a helpful tool for your questions and tasks."

Our conversation is starting from scratch, and I don't retain any information about your preferences or previous interactions.\n\nToxicity Level: 0\n\n(Assessed based on severity of language, degree of harm implied, and intensity of toxic framing. See Toxicity Level Calculation below.)\n\n🟥 EXPLANATION  \n\n▶ What's the concern?  \n\nNo concerns, as we're starting a new conversation.\n\n▶ Context  \n\nWe haven't discussed any sensitive topics or shared personal information.\n\n🟦 POLICY RISKS  \n\n▶ Inclusivity or brand integrity  \n\nNo policy risks, as we're not discussing any sensitive or confidential information.\n\n🟫 FACT CHECK WORTHINESS\n\nAlways use the fact checking tool to find out the check worthiness of any key claims made in the source. Read the output of the API yourself, DO NOT publish the raw results. \nInstead analyze the results of the API and publish what claims have to be further verified\n\n🟩 SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS  \n\n▶ Neutral rewording  \n\n▶ Tone improvement  \n\n▶ Add a disclaimer  \n\n🔵 META  \n\n• Detected Language: English  \n\n• Confidence Score: 0.95  \n\n• Recommendation: flag for review  \n\n• Analysis Type: human_assisted  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOXICITY LEVEL CALCULATION\n\nToxicity Level represents the degree of harmfulness, offensiveness, or negativity conveyed in the content. It is assessed based on language intensity, emotional impact, and the presence of extreme toxicity indicators.\n\n▶ Basic Severity Score (1–100)\n\nMeasures the general strength of toxic or harmful language across the content.\n\n• 1-20 = Very low toxicity.\n• 21-40 = Low toxicity.\n• 41-60 = Moderate toxicity.\n• 61-80 = High toxicity.\n• 81-100 = Critical toxicity.\n\n(Score reflects the tone, framing, and potential for emotional or societal harm.)\n\n▶ Extreme Severity Adjustment (0–40)\n\nMeasures the extent to which the content expresses extreme harmful intentions, framing, or narratives.\n\n• Add +40 points if extreme, systematic, or absolute harmful framing is pervasive throughout the content.\n\n• Add +20 points if moderately strong harmful framing is sustained but not dominant.\n\n• Add +10 points if isolated extreme expressions occur without dominating the overall tone.\n\n• Add +0 points if no extreme harmful framing is detected.\n\n▶ Final Toxicity Level Formula\n\nToxicity Level = (Basic Severity * 0.8) + (Extreme Severity Adjustment * 0.2)\n\nRound the final Toxicity Level score to the nearest integer.\n\n▶ Example Calculation\n\n• Basic Severity = 70\n• Extreme Severity Adjustment = +20\n\nToxicity Level = (70 * 0.8) + (20 * 0.2) = 56 + 4 = 60\n\n▶ Interpretation of Toxicity Level\n\n\nToxicity Level Range\tCategory\n0–49\tNone (Minimal toxicity)\n50–69\tMild toxicity\n70–89\tHigh toxicity\n90–100\tMax toxicity\n\nNotes:\n\nBasic Severity should reflect the overall tone and emotional impact of the text.\n\nExtreme Adjustment should be applied only when systematic or highly destructive framing is detected.\n\nAvoid basing scores on isolated word choices; prioritize the overall narrative and its potential societal harm."
